# Use Docker

## Narrative

Look, I want to keep this as simple as I can.  I don't really enjoy
reading pages of pages of documentation on the latest greatest coolest
piece of infrastructure kit.  I really just want to encrypt my DNS
traffic when it leaves my home network and move on with life.

This is a single host setup.  Plain old `docker` is just fine.
