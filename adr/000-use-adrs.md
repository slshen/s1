# Use architectural decision records

## Status

## Narrative

So I find that I make a lot of decisions in my head without writing down
exactly (or even vaguely) why I've done things in particular ways.  Sometimes
there is a good reason, and sometimes there isn't and unless you're in my
head you'd never know the one from the other.

(And sometimes I forget why I've done things in a certain way, so I'm
often my own audience here.)

So this https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record
seems like a good idea.  I'm going to give it a go.

I've chosen an extremely barebones template with a title, status, and
narrative.
