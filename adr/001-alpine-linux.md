# Use Alpine Linux

## Narrative

Since I've got a Intel NUC-class machine i.e. actual physical hardware I've
got to run something on it.  [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) is small
and easy to understand, so why not.

I did briefly consider using the free
[VMWare vSphere Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor.html)
but it doesn't boot on my particular machine.

See (../host_setup.sh) for pseudo-code on how the host has been setup.
(In reality the host was setup by hand.)
