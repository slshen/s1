# s1 - Single Host Simple Docker

This repo contains the setup that I use to run a couple of docker
containers at home on an Intel NUC-class machine (Intel Pentium Silver
J5005 with 8GB ram.)

This is my actual setup. (Any sensitve data isn't here, it's either
resident locally on the machine or been pushed into my own private s3
bucket.)

I've decided to write down my choices in [architecture design record form](adr).
